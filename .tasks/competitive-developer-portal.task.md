# competitive-developer-portal

Created: `2025-06-02`
Status: `pending`

## Problem Statement

Build an enterprise-grade developer portal using Backstage that competes with Janus IDP and Roadie, demonstrating that paid plugins can be done for free and open source. The goal is to prove the power of Backstage while offering superior developer experience compared to existing solutions, with an alternative pricing model that eliminates per-seat costs.

Current market leaders like Roadie charge $22/dev/month and SaaS solutions create vendor lock-in. Raw Backstage requires significant setup and maintenance overhead. This project aims to bridge that gap by providing a production-ready, open-source developer portal with enterprise features.
