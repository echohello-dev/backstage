# Troubleshooting

This guide provides solutions to common issues you might encounter while developing or using the Mobile Banking App.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. App Crashes on Startup

**Possible Causes:**
- Outdated dependencies
- Corrupted build files

**Solutions:**
1. Update all dependencies to their latest compatible versions.
2. Clear the build cache and rebuild the app:
   ```
   npm run clean
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

### 2. Authentication Failures

**Possible Causes:**
- Expired or invalid access token
- Network connectivity issues

**Solutions:**
1. Implement a token refresh mechanism if not already in place.
2. Check the device's network connection and retry the authentication process.
3. Clear the app's stored credentials and ask the user to log in again.

### 3. Slow Performance

**Possible Causes:**
- Inefficient API calls
- Large unoptimized images or assets

**Solutions:**
1. Implement caching for frequently accessed data.
2. Optimize images and other assets for mobile devices.
3. Use performance profiling tools to identify and resolve bottlenecks.

## Debugging Tips

- Use React Native Debugger for a better debugging experience.
- Implement comprehensive error logging to capture and analyze issues.
- Utilize crash reporting tools like Crashlytics to track and diagnose crashes in production.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter a bug that isn't covered in this guide, please report it by following these steps:

1. Check the existing issues in the project repository to avoid duplicates.
2. If the issue is new, create a detailed bug report including:
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Expected behavior
   - Actual behavior
   - Device information (OS version, device model)
   - App version
   - Any relevant logs or screenshots

For security-related issues, please report them directly to the security team at security@example.com instead of creating a public issue.
