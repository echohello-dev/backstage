# User Authentication

The Mobile Banking App uses a robust authentication system to ensure secure access to user accounts.

## Authentication Flow

1. **Login Screen**: Users enter their username and password.
2. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Optional 2FA using SMS or authenticator app.
3. **Biometric Authentication**: Support for fingerprint or face recognition on compatible devices.

## Security Measures

- Secure storage of credentials using device keychain
- Token-based authentication with short-lived access tokens and refresh tokens
- Automatic logout after a period of inactivity
- Encryption of sensitive data in transit and at rest

## Integration with Authentication Service API

The app integrates with the Authentication Service API for user verification and token management. See the [Authentication Service API](../api_integration/authentication_service_api.md) documentation for details.

## Implementation Details

- Use of React Native's `Keychain` module for secure credential storage
- Integration with device biometric APIs (Touch ID / Face ID for iOS, Fingerprint / Face Unlock for Android)
- Custom hooks for managing authentication state and token refresh

## Error Handling

- Clear error messages for invalid credentials, network issues, or server errors
- Graceful degradation when biometric authentication is unavailable

## Best Practices for Developers

- Never store passwords in plain text
- Use HTTPS for all network communications
- Implement certificate pinning to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks
- Regularly update and rotate encryption keys
- Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- Use secure random number generation for tokens and salts
