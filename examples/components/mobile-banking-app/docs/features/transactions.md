# Transactions

The Transactions feature allows users to view their transaction history and perform new transactions.

## Key Components

1. **Transaction List**: Displays recent transactions with details like date, amount, and description
2. **Transaction Details**: Shows full details of a selected transaction
3. **New Transaction**: Interface for initiating new transactions (transfers, payments)

## Data Fetching

- Uses the Transaction API to retrieve transaction history and post new transactions
- Implements pagination for efficient loading of large transaction histories

## UI/UX Considerations

- Infinite scroll for transaction history
- Clear categorization and visual indicators for different transaction types
- Search and filter functionality for finding specific transactions

## Security

- Requires additional authentication for high-value transactions
- Implements fraud detection checks in real-time during transaction processing

## Performance Optimization

- Caching of recent transactions for offline viewing
- Optimistic UI updates for immediate feedback on new transactions

## Integration with Transaction API

See the [Transaction API Integration](../api_integration/transaction_api.md) documentation for details on how the app interacts with the backend for transaction-related operations.
