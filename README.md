Welcome to our Backstage Showcase repository! This project demonstrates the power and versatility of the [Backstage](https://backstage.io) developer portal platform.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The main goals of this **showcase** are to:

1. Demonstrate the capabilities and benefits of Backstage as a developer portal solution
2. Provide a reference implementation that teams can use as a starting point for their own Backstage deployments
3. Highlight the extensibility of Backstage through a curated selection of plugins

## ðŸ§© Plugins

The Backstage Showcase features a curated selection of powerful plugins:
